## Component Descriptions

### Camera

- **Usage**: Used to capture images of the crops.
- **Connection**: Directly connected to the Raspberry Pi model via either USB port or the 15-pin header provided for the camera interface of the Raspberry Pi.

### Raspberry Pi

- **Description**: A small-sized module akin to a small computer.
- **Functionality**: Receives images captured by the camera, processes, and analyzes them using TensorFlow to detect specific features or conditions.

### Irrigation System

- **Functionality**: Utilizes data from the Raspberry Pi to determine the precise watering needs of plants or crops.
- **Automation**: Can be connected to a pump linked to a water reservoir for automated irrigation.

### Sensors

#### Soil Moisture Sensor

- **Functionality**: Measures the volume of water content in the soil, helping to estimate the volume of stored water in the soil range.
- **Usage**: Integrated into the irrigation system to optimize water scheduling and minimize excessive water use.

#### DHT11 and FC28

- **DHT11**: Measures temperature and humidity, providing essential data for assessing environmental conditions affecting crop health.
- **FC28**: A soil moisture sensor that aids in monitoring the water content in the soil, crucial for efficient irrigation practices.

### Cloud Storage

- **Platform**: Firebase server.
- **Purpose**: Stores data from sensors and images for logging and further analysis.
